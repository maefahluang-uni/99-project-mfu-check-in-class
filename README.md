MFU Check-in Class
=============

# Description

Mae Fah Luang University lecturers can manage their class check-in information using the MFU check-in web application system. The web application we wrote focuses on solving the old problem of name verification. You can check the class schedule on the web application. Is this class open for check-in yet? Lecturers can set class check-in on or off in real time. And there are various status indicators of real-time class check-in. The web application can also collect information on which days students come to check their names. And lecturers can also see the attendance rate.
From the student's perspective The "MFU Check-In" web application should present an accessible and user-friendly interface. Helps you access your daily class schedule. Real-time check-in status and check-in history easily Students should be notified in a timely manner. Can give feedback about the system. Ensure a smooth experience while prioritizing data privacy, security, and reliable performance.
From the admin's perspective Admin will not be able to view information regarding check-in. Admin can only edit users or courses, such as adding lecturers.
